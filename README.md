# COMP486_Project

The Rent Price Prediction Model project aims to develop a machine learning model that estimates rental
prices in all counties within the United States, based on factors such as location and square footage.

We make use of the Scikit-Learn and Keras/TensorFlow Pyhton libraries to construct various models that estimate rental property price.
